**Block Messenger** is an educational project that simulates a basic blockchain-based messenger with integrated coin functionality.  It's built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating fundamental blockchain concepts in a simplified, interactive way.  This project is intended for learning purposes and is *not* suitable for real-world cryptocurrency transactions or secure messaging.

**[Important Note]:** This project is a *simulation* and does not implement a true distributed network, robust consensus algorithm, or secure smart contracts. It is designed to illustrate concepts, not to provide production-ready functionality.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Simulated Blockchain:**  Messages and coin transactions are added to a simplified blockchain structure.  This includes:
    *   **Block Creation:**  Each block contains a timestamp, data (messages or transactions), the previous block's hash, and a nonce (for Proof-of-Work simulation).
    *   **Hashing:**  Uses CryptoJS's SHA256 algorithm for hashing.
    *   **Proof-of-Work (PoW):**  Simulates mining with adjustable difficulty.  A loading animation visually represents the mining process.
    *   **Chain Validation:**  Includes a basic `isChainValid()` function to demonstrate integrity checks.
*   **Messaging:**
    *   Send and receive text messages.
    *   Messages are displayed in a chat-like interface with timestamps.
    *   Emoji support.
    *   Distinguishes between messages sent by the current user and other (simulated) users.
*   **Coin System (Simulated):**
    *   Each "node" (browser tab) starts with an initial coin balance.
    *   Users earn a small "mining reward" for each block created (when sending a message or a transaction).
    *   Coin transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
    *   A simple modal allows users to send coins (to a placeholder "otherNode").
    *   Balance updates are reflected in the UI.
*   **UI/UX:**
    *   Mobile-first design, resembling an iPhone-style messaging app.
    *   Basic animations (loading spinner, button hover effects).
*   **Debugging:**  A hidden section (toggleable) displays the current blockchain data in JSON format.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:**  For structure and content.
*   **CSS3:**  For styling and layout.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):**  For all logic, including blockchain simulation, message handling, and UI interactions.
*   **CryptoJS:**  For SHA256 hashing ([https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/4.1.1/crypto-js.min.js](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/4.1.1/crypto-js.min.js)).

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hwkims/block.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd block
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**  No server is required; you can simply double-click the file.

## üß™ Testing and Interaction

*   **Send Messages:** Type a message in the input field and press Enter or click the "Send" button.  A loading animation will appear briefly, simulating the mining process.
*   **Send Coins:** Click the coin icon to open the coin transfer modal. Enter an amount and click "Send".  Again, a loading animation will simulate mining.
*   **Open Multiple Tabs:** For a better simulation of a multi-node network, open the `index.html` file in multiple browser tabs.  Each tab represents a separate "node." *Note:*  There is no actual data synchronization between tabs. Each tab maintains its own independent blockchain.
*   **Developer Tools:**  Use your browser's developer tools (usually F12) to:
    *   Inspect the console for "Block mined" messages.
    *   Examine the `myBlockchain` object to see the current state of the blockchain.
    *   (Optional)  Unhide the `#blockchain-info` div to view the blockchain data directly on the page.
    *   Experiment with modifying the blockchain data manually to test the `isChainValid()` function.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Future Improvements

This project is a simplified simulation and has several limitations:

*   **No Real P2P Network:**  There's no actual peer-to-peer communication.  Opening multiple tabs simulates multiple nodes, but they don't interact.  True P2P would require technologies like WebRTC and a signaling server (which needs a backend like Node.js).
*   **Simplified Consensus:** The project uses a basic Proof-of-Work simulation and a rudimentary "longest chain" rule, but it doesn't handle real-world consensus challenges (like forks or network latency).
*   **No Smart Contracts:** The "coin" functionality is implemented directly in JavaScript.  It does not represent true smart contract capabilities.
*   **Security:**  This project is *not* secure and should *never* be used for real-world cryptocurrency or sensitive data.  There is no key management, transaction signing, or protection against various attacks.
*   **Persistence:**  Data is lost when the browser tab is closed.  Persistence would require a backend (database) or distributed storage (like IPFS).

**Potential Future Enhancements (Beyond the Scope of this Simple Project):**

*   Implement basic P2P communication using WebRTC (requires a signaling server).
*   Explore more sophisticated consensus algorithms.
*   Simulate basic smart contract features with more complex JavaScript functions.
*   Add a visual representation of the blockchain (blocks and connections).
*   Use a library like `localForage` for basic data persistence within the browser.
